## How to edit

1. Please use an editor that performs proper indentation. So not the built-in editor (BlueJ)(This is because BlueJ does a Notepad by handling a tab as eight spaces, and handling indentation as inserting four spaces.This is extremely annoying when actually trying to edit code in a more powerful editor like Notepad++, Eclipse (theoretically)or even macOS applications like TextMate or Sublime Text. On Linux, well, you shouldn't really need to ask, you should be a power user.
2. Download Greenfoot.

## How it Works
This section is to-do, really.
### The Player
The player is responsible for it's own damage detection and managing it's own animations.
